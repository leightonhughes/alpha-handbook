Hi everyone!

Here is tonight's schedule and list of small group allocations.

As mentioned, we will probably get walk-ins so we will just add them to small groups according to age and who comes in tonight! Groups may be on the larger side tonight.

I'm printing the schedule and small group list for each of us, which we will be handed out tonight during set up! 

God bless,
Coordinator Name
