# Small Group Setup

Setting up a small group gathering at a church involves creating an intimate and conducive environment for discussion, study, or fellowship. Here are step-by-step instructions for setting up a small group space:

## Materials and Equipment Needed:

- Chairs or seating options
- Tables (if needed)
- Comfortable seating cushions or pads (optional)
- Room dividers or partitions (optional)


## Instructions:

1. Planning and Layout:
- Decide on the seating arrangement based on the number of participants and the nature of the gathering. Options may include a circle, U-shape, or small clusters of chairs.

2. Seating Arrangement:
- Set up chairs: Arrange the chairs in a manner that encourages interaction and discussion. Ensure that everyone has a clear line of sight to the center if you're using a whiteboard or presentation screen.

3. Tables and Study Materials:
- Provide tables (if needed): If participants require tables for note-taking or to hold study materials, provide appropriately sized tables or desks.
- Place study materials: Set out any Bibles, books, or handouts that will be used during the gathering.

4. Room Dividers or Partitions (optional):
- If you need to separate the small group area from other spaces within the church, use room dividers or partitions to create a private environment.

5. Post-Event:
- Coordinate cleanup, including tidying up the seating area, putting away study materials, and turning off equipment.
