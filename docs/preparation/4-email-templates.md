## Preparation 1 template (1 month before Alpha start)

**To: Promo team**<br>
**Subject: Promo and marketing our Alpha**

Just starting a thread with the three of us to get the ball rolling on a few things!

Firstly - we're the marketing team for the next Alpha woohooo ! üòéüî•

Just wanted to share this link that Alpha recently circulated with fresh new promo materials. We can customize any of the details and wording via the canva file they make available.

Would be great to have a look through the link when you get a chance and see what we might like to print out to have ready for our promo weekends at Masses.

I think it would be cool to print:

A2 Posters 
A5 flyers 
Maybe business cards?

When we decide, I'm happy to print at the parish office next week. I'm not sure if there is any budget for this side of stuff.

God bless,
Coordinator Name


## Preparation 2 template (2 weeks before Alpha start)

**To: Leadership team**<br>
**Subject: Alpha links and roles from meeting**

Hi everyone,

So great to meet with you all yesterday - thanks for being there and for all the ideas/feedback and input!

I've attached the agenda we worked through yesterday to this email for your reference, but I will also include some more important snapshots in this email below.

- As for speaking at Masses - thank you all for kindly volunteering your time! Here is the schedule below. 

- I've attached the script for those who will be speaking at Masses to this email. Please feel free to "make it your own" however I found that this spiel was really helpful when we shared it last time as it presents the right tone. Speaking at Masses is most effective when you try to sound as natural and relational as possible. If you can try to make it not sound like you're reading a script, that would be even better! And remember that you're allowed to smile and you're allowed to be engaging and making people laugh too! Please remember you only have 3-4 minutes to speak!

- I've included the list of everyone's allocated Alpha roles at the bottom of this email. A reminder that the star next to a role means that you are the lead for that service :) 

I'll be in touch with you all via the chat as our promotional materials are ready and i'll send through an update and refresher re: speaking at Masses next week!

God bless you all and thank you again for your service. Let's keep this upcoming Alpha in our prayers!

God bless,
Coordinator Name


## Preparation 3 template (1 week before Alpha start)

**To: Leadership team**<br>
**Subject: Alpha is BACK!**

Good morning!!

Hope this email finds you very well ‚òÄ It's hard to believe that it's the end of September already and that we are set to run Alpha again at Good Shepherd! 

We would love as many people who have not yet walked the Alpha journey to hear about it and come along, which is why I am emailing to ask you a favour üôè Will you take the time to invite someone else to come along to Alpha? The Alpha experience is a treasure worth sharing and we would love your help to spread the word!

Feel free to share the following with anyone you'd like to invite:
- Click HERE for a promotion clip (you may see some familiar scenes and faces from our Alpha!) 
- I've attached the flyer for the upcoming Alpha 
- This is the link for the Alpha Registration page:  Link here
Lastly, please pray for us and all the new Alpha guests as we launch into the second round! We will be praying for you too!

God bless,
Coordinator Name


## Week 1 email template

**To: Helpers**<br>
**Subject: Week 1 schedule and small group allocations**


Hi everyone!

Here is tonight's schedule and list of small group allocations.

As mentioned, we will probably get walk-ins so we will just add them to small groups according¬†to age and who comes in tonight! Groups may be on the larger side tonight.

I'm printing the schedule and small group list for each of us, which we will be handed out tonight during set up!¬†

God bless,
Coordinator Name
