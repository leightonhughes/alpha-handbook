# Video Setup

Setting up video and sound for an Alpha night requires careful planning and coordination. Here are step-by-step instructions to help you set up video and sound equipment effectively:

## Materials and Equipment Needed:

- Projector or TV screen
- Sound system (Speakers, mixer, microphones)
- Video source (e.g laptop)
- HDMI Cable and connectors
- Power strips and extensions cords
- Audio cables/mixer
- Mic and music stands (if applicable)

## Instructions

### 1. Preparation:
- Plan the layout: Decide on the best location for your video projector, screen, and sound equipment. Ensure that they are easily visible and accessible to the audience while not obstructing anyone's view.

### 2. Power Setup:
- Locate power sources: Identify available power outlets and ensure there are enough for all your equipment. Use surge protectors and extension cords as needed.
- Connect all the equipment to power and test to ensure they are functioning correctly.

### 3. Sound Setup:
- Set up the audio mixer: Adjust the mixer's settings to achieve the desired sound quality. Balance the levels for each microphone and input source.
- Connect the mixer to the speakers: Use appropriate audio cables to connect the mixer's output to the speakers.
Test the sound system: Ensure that sound is clear and evenly distributed throughout the venue. Adjust the volume as necessary.

### 4. Video Setup:
- Place the projector: Set up the projector on a stable surface or mount it securely. Ensure that it's at the right height and angle to project onto the screen.
- Connect the video source: Use the appropriate cables to connect your video source (e.g., laptop or DVD player) to the projector. Make sure the source is set to duplicate or extend the display as required.
- Adjust projector settings: Configure the projector's resolution and other settings to match your video source and screen.
- Test the video: Play a test video to ensure it displays correctly and is visible to the audience. Adjust focus, brightness, and keystone correction if necessary.

### 5. Cable Management:
- Secure cables: Use tape or cable organizers to keep cables neat and prevent tripping hazards. Run cables along walls or under rugs if possible.
- Label cables: Label each cable to make it easier to identify and troubleshoot any issues during the event.

### Rehearsal:
- Conduct a sound and video check with the performers or speakers to ensure everything is working smoothly.

### Backup Equipment:
- Have backup microphones, cables, batteries and other essential items on hand in case of equipment failures.

### Event Time:
- Arrive early on the day of the event to perform final checks and ensure everything is set up and working properly.
- Appoint someone to operate the sound and video equipment during the event to make adjustments as needed.

### Post-Event:
- Carefully disconnect and pack all equipment.
- Label and store cables and equipment properly for future us.
